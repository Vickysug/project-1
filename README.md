* [Open Street Map - Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/about.html)
* [Pravatar](https://pravatar.cc/)

## Installation
The application does not require any installation or build system. Please visit [https://vickysug.github.io/spotted-app/](https://vickysug.github.io/spotted-app/) to test the app. See Usage section below for further details.
## Usage
* The app utilises an initialisation process to mimic a single page application. It retrieves data from corresponding APIs, creates objects, persists them to localStorage, and finally renders the UI.
* Viewing posts is open to public and does not require authentication. However, to compose a new post, the app requires authentication. Please use the following credentials to log in OR alternatively, if you want to test with different users, you can get credential details from localStorage.
  * **Login Details** 
    * `Email address`: demo@demo.com `Password`: 12345
* The app supports new user registration with each input being checked and validated. After the form is validated and user is saved, the app will authenticate the newly created user automatically.
* Getting current location information requires user permission. Follow the browser prompt to allow location access.
## Features
* The app implements user authentication, generates authentication token, saves it to sessionStorage
* The app implements user registration and supports form validation
* The app supports reverse GeoCoding with Open Street Map API. It gets the user's current coordinates and resolves it to an address. 
* The app supports Quill.js text editor. It supports rich text format.
* The app uses Modal and Dropdown objects from Flowbite to control modals and user dropdown menu programmatically
* The app uses Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to persist data to localStorage, implements security, and encapsulates global variables. It borrows the naming convention from Spring Framework.
  * **[Persistence Context](assets/js/persistence-context.js)**: 
    * Persistence Context creates Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
    * Uses Map as data structure
    * Allows persisting data to and retrieving from localStorage
    * Generates sequential ids while creating objects
    * Persistence context is extended by three objects:
      * **UserRepository**: The object provides methods to work with the User object:
        * `saveUser()`: Saves the given user object. `Returns` user. 
        * `createUser()`: Assigns a sequential id to the user object and saves it to localStorage. `Returns` user.
        * `findAll()`: Returns an array of all users.
        * `findUserById()`: Finds and returns the user with the given id. Returns `false` if user does not exist.
        * `findUserByUsername()`: Finds and returns the user with the given username. Returns `false` if user not exist.
        * `findUserByEmail()`: Finds and returns the user with the given email address. Returns `false` if user not exist.
        * `getAllPostsByUserId()` Returns all posts by the user with the given id. Return `false` if no post is available.
      * **PostRepository**: The object provides methods to work with the Post object:
        * `savePost()`: Saves the given post object. `Returns` post.
        * `createPost()`: Assigns a sequential id to the post object and saves it to localStorage. `Returns` post.
        * `findAll()`: Returns an array of all posts.
        * `findPostById()`: Finds and returns the post with the given id. Returns `false` if post does not exist.
      * **LocationRepository**: The object provides methods to work with the Location object:
        * `saveLocation()`: Saves the given location object. `Returns` location.
        * `findAll()`: Returns an array of all locations.
        * `findLocationById()`: Finds and returns the location with the given id. Returns `false` if location does not exist.
        * `getLocationByPostId`: Finds location for the given id. Returns `false` if location does not exist.
  * **[Security Context](assets/js/security-context.js)**
    * Security Context implements security and authentication.
    * Uses Map as data structure
    * Implements user authentication, generates a token and saves it to sessionStorage
    * Supports user log out, which clears authentication token from sessionStorage
    * If localStorage is cleared while the authentication token remains in sessionStorage, the app clears sessionStorage and requires re-initialisation.
    * Security context has the following methods:
      * `getAuthenticationToken()`: Retrieves authentication token from sessionStorage. Returns `false` if `jwt-token` key does not exist in sessionStorage.
      * `isAuthenticated()`: Checks if a given user is authenticated. Returns `true` or `false`.
      * `isCredentialsCorrect()`: Checks if a given user's credentials are correct. Returns `true` or `false`.
      * `authenticateUser()`: Authenticates user, generates a token, and save it to sessionStorage. Returns `authToken`.
      * `logout()`: Logs out the authenticated user and clears sessionStorage. Returns `false`, if logout fails.
  * **[Application Context](assets/js/application-context.js)**
    * Application Context encapsulates global variables to keep them organised and manageable. 
    * It currently encapsulates the following variables:
      * `resolvedLocation`: Location variable which stores the user's current location
      * `formValidationSuccess`: CSS styling for valid for form inputs
      * `formValidationError`: CSS styling for invalid for form inputs
      * `formInputDefaultStyle`: Default CSS styling for form inputs
## Limitations
* The app currently does not currently support multi-user authentication
* The app currently does not support delete or edit operations
* The app currently does not support searching locations by name, which is also known as forward GeoCoding
* The app currently only searches through available posts in the DOM. It does not search in localStorage
